\title{
Writing an empirical design research paper
}

\section{Summary}

This chapter provides advice on how to write up your design study. After discussing the elements of a paper, from introduction to discussion, I focus on how to make your text coherent by ensuring that all relevant inferential and referential relationships are clear.

Writing an academic paper is quite a challenge for most design researchers, but the good news is that it can be learned by following a few guidelines and studying successful examples. In this chapter, I provide general advice on writing empirical papers, with special attention to reporting findings from design research. As McKenney and Reeves (2012) observe, writing, reviewing, and publishing occurs in commissive spaces of people who more or less agree on the ground rules of their discipline. The disadvantage of design researchers is that they have to explain more to their non-design oriented colleagues about their approach than vice versa. Several decades ago, scholars who published case studies or ethnographies were in a somewhat similar position (Easley, 1977); a substantial part of their papers was dedicated to why they used these research approaches. This implies that design researchers have to choose their journals carefully. Some journals welcome long manuscripts (e.g., Cognition \& Instruction; Journal of the Learning Sciences); other journals explicitly welcome design studies (Educational Designer, Educational Design Research - An International Journal for Design Based Research in Education; Educational Technology Research and Development); several mathematics education research journals regularly publish design research papers. Special issues can also be a venue for design researchers, provided that the guest editors and reviewers have at least some sympathy for what design researchers aim to do. However, the most important task is to write not merely well, but very well. 

\section{Chain of reasoning}

Each research project has a particular logic, and a paper about it should reflect this logic. Krathwohl (1998) compared a research report with a chain of reasoning that is as strong as its weakest link. For example, you might address a particular problem and propose a potential solution. The research project's goal is to figure out how to make your idea work, so you have a conjecture or a research question on some specific aspect of the potential solution (say a teaching strategy). You apply particular research methods to test the high-level conjecture or answer your question, which leads to results. The results are then discussed in the final section, where one also reflects on how well the question was answered and what the implications of your findings are.

I always advise my students to start with what I call a skeleton, a one-page outline of your paper's chain of reasoning. And I often also make such skeletons myself. The ingredients of a skeleton are: title, problem, solution direction, knowledge gap, research aim, research question, relevance of answering the question, and methodological approach. The advantage of having this on one page is that you can easily see whether concepts in the title recur in the rest of the story and whether the research aim is linked well with the initial problem. It may also become visible that your envisioned methods are suitable for an evaluative experiment, but not for the how-question you intend to answer. So here is the first guideline for writing $(G)$ :

G1: Make a one-page outline of your paper's chain of reasoning to check if it makes sense (skeleton).

\section{The general "shape" of a paper}

The general shape of a research paper can be visualized as zooming in and out. The start of a paper should be broad enough to seduce readers into your topic (zooming in), except when your first sentences state the purpose of your paper. How broad you start depends on the scope of the journal or the audience. If you write for a special issue on a particular topic, there is no need to start much broader, but if you write for a general educational journal, you might need to speak to a wider field before you zoom in on your specific subfield or topic. You relate your work to that of others and identify the knowledge gap.

The narrowest part of the paper is the middle - the methods and results sections, which are specific to your own project. In the results section, you do not (or hardly) refer to other people's work.

In the discussion, you zoom out again and relate to the broader field of study. Implications for practice and limitations of your approach are discussed (zooming out).You relate your findings to the work of others or future research to be done. For a feeling of closure, it is worth trying to return to the title or topic of your first paragraph. This gives the reader a sense of the text being a whole.

G2: Ensure that your paper starts broad enough. Zoom in on the knowledge gap and your goal or research question. In the discussion, you zoom out again.

\section{Ingredients of a paper}

The guidelines of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (6th edition; APA6) are worth studying in detail. For advice on each section of a paper, even on titles, also see for instance Wallwork (2011), but note that he wrote for disciplines other than education. Here I summarize the main topics that keep recurring in my educational research methods courses and research projects.

\section{Title}

The most important function of a title is that it catches the attention of the right audience. It should contain the key concepts or the key message of your research. Keep the title relatively short. APA6 recommends up to 12 words.

In educational research you will often see catchy titles, sometimes with student quotes. If these do capture your key messages, fine, but if the reader has little clue in what subdomain of educational research this is situated, then it may be better to use a "boring" but informative title. In some disciplines, the colon (:) is avoided, but in educational research, it is common and useful.

From a coherence perspective, it is key that the title fits the purpose, question, and the rest of the publication's skeleton. It will typically cover a slightly broader topic than your specific focus to draw a potentially wider interested readership. For design studies I often like titles that link a design idea to an intended outcome, for example "Seeding Evolutionary Thinking by Engaging Children in Modeling its Foundations" (Lehrer \& Schauble, 2012).

Note that most journals also ask for a running head, which is a summary of the title in often up to 50 characters. The running head is used as a header in the paper or chapter itself.

\section{Abstract}

The abstract is perhaps the most important single paragraph of your paper. It is read more than any other paragraph, and it is pivotal in readers' decision whether or not to download and read the paper.

Having done several review studies, I know how frustrating it is if abstracts do not contain the relevant information that a scholar needs to judge if a paper fits particular search criteria. Also make sure the abstract is self-contained, which means it can be read as a stand-alone text, preferably without any references to other publications. The APA6 (2010) guidelines are again useful here. In an empirical paper make sure you address:

- The problem in one sentence

- Participants (age, grade, ...)

- Research approach

- Key findings

- Brief discussion or implication.

If you have more space than say 120 words, also add a research goal or question, or any other relevant information (knowledge gap, definitions). Sometimes design researchers start their abstract with the goal, for example: "The goal of this classroom study of third-grade students was to support and document the emergence of multiple senses of mathematical similarity" (Lehrer, Strom, \& Confrey, 2002, p. 359).

\section{Introduction}

There are two common shapes for introductions: the funnel (start of the aforementioned zooming in) and what I call the reverse pear (see Figures 7.1 and 7.2). The funnel is the most common one (Swales \& Feak, 2004).

The funnel shape introduction involves the following steps:

1 Introduction of an interesting topic or societal problem (the reader needs to be convinced of the practical and/or theoretical relevance of the paper). In design research, the problem is often a gap between the current and desirable situation (McKenney \& Reeves, 2012). Many papers start with a problem, such as low interest in STEM subjects, need for teacher professional development, or poor preparation for what students need in the twenty-first century. The challenge could also be to contribute to more equitable or accessible education (e.g., Mintrop, 2016).

2 Narrow down to a specific aspect or potential solution (zoom in). In design research this often means you sketch solution that have been tried so far, or argue that new opportunities have arisen to tackle a persistent problem (e.g., new technology, new theory, new learning arrangements).

3 Identification of a knowledge gap; formulation of purpose, hypothesis, or research question of the paper. Identify or carve out your niche: convince the reader that it is necessary to fill the gap. It is not enough to state that little is known or little research has been done on this topic. The key issue is that more or better insight into the topic is needed to resolve the aforementioned problem.

Figure 7.I Funnel

4 State the research aim, and possibly also the research question, which naturally follows from the knowledge gap. My personal preference is to end the introduction with the research aim or question. This is where experienced readers expect such key information to be placed (if not already presented at the beginning of the introduction). One could add a sentence on how an answer to this research question will help to resolve the aforementioned problem. This gives the introduction a well-rounded feeling.

Sometimes people add a description of what the reader can expect in the publication. This is not really necessary if the paper follows the standard format of empirical research papers. Such advance organizers may be appreciated if you decide to deviate from standard practice.

In medium-sized papers of about 6,000 to 8,000 words, the introduction is typically about four paragraphs - one for each step. If you need to discuss why a solution or instructional idea did not quite work and why you will try something else, you might need an extra paragraph, or perhaps you need an extra 

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_04_28_f487dca778a7ad0d1c37g-06.jpg?height=1121&width=691&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=406)

Figure 7.2 Reverse pear

paragraph to define a key concept (e.g., scaffolding, drawing-based modeling, inquiry-based learning, connectivism).

What I call the reverse pear introduction is almost the same, except that it starts with the aim of the paper - the top of the reverse pear, after which the funnel starts. The advantage of such a start is that the quick reader immediately knows what the paper is about, which is important in times when people read a lot online and are always in a hurry (Wallwork, 2011). However, this approach can only be applied if the concepts used to describe the purpose need little explanation. If you need to explain technical concepts, it might be necessary to introduce these before the purpose can be stated. In the context of a special issue on statistics education, this held for the following first sentence: "The purpose of this paper is to provide an analysis of fifth-grade students' emergent expressions of uncertainty in the context of drawing inferences informally from growing data sets" (Ben-Zvi, Aridor, Makar, \& Bakker, 2012, p. 913).

G3: The function of an introduction is to convince your readers of the relevance of your topic, the need to fill a knowledge gap, and to narrow down to the aim of your paper. The aim of your paper is typically the end of the funnel but could also be the very first sentence.

\section{Theoretical background}

In some disciplines and with short papers in education, there is no need to have a separate section titled "Theoretical Background" or "Conceptual framework." If the key concepts and the survey of what is known and unknown about your topic are clear in a relatively short introduction, then there is no reason to go deeper or broader in a second section. In some cases, it is easier to go straight to writing the methods section, because it can be challenging to split up what you want to tell from a helicopter view in the introduction and what you want to discuss in-depth in the theoretical background section.

For a theoretical background you can think of at least three basic structures, which can also be combined (Weissberg \& Buker, 1990):

1 Historically or chronologically. For example, if you want to develop an alternative approach to transfer, you may want to go back to the origin of this concept over a hundred years ago (Tuomi-Gröhn \& Engeström, 2003).

2 From broad to narrow. If your topic is, say, drawing-based modeling in astronomy (van Joolingen, Aukes, Gijlers, \& Bollen, 2015), you can start with the importance of modeling in science, argue for the potential of drawingbased modeling, and zoom in via physics on the domain of astronomy.

3 By theme. Assume that your purpose and/or main research question entails two key concepts; then it makes sense to address these two one by one. For example, if you use a modeling approach to teaching about evolution, you can address the learning goal and the teaching approach one by one (Lehrer \& Schauble, 2012).

4 Rationale behind design. In design research specifically, you can use the theoretical background to explicate the main reasons behind your design. We have done this in, for example, Smit, Bakker,Van Eerde, and Kuijpers (2016). The advantage is that a description of an intervention, tool, or whatever you have designed is often too complex for a subsection of the methods section.

If the main research question has not already been formulated in the introduction, the end of the theoretical background is the logical place to put it, possibly complemented with subquestions. This position is natural because the next step in the paper is to argue what steps you took to answer the question(s). 

\section{Methods section}

In reports from design research it is wise to start the methods section with a brief explanation of why the question raised, often a how-question, requires design research. Typical argumentation goes as follows: Given that the intended or desirable learning process $\mathrm{X}$ could not be observed in regular educational settings, we had to design something to ensure that $\mathrm{X}$ would happen. To this end, we deployed the approach of design research (or "conducted a design study"). If you have not used a control or comparison group because your aim is to prove that something is possible, or if any solution is already better than none, then you may have to explain to readers from other commissive spaces that a control group was not used because you aimed for different learning goals than in regular education, or because your aim was to explore the potential of idea Y, not to prove that it worked better than Z. It may also be wise to describe the procedure to give the reader a sense of what you have done to get your results.

After a brief general introduction on the research approach or strategy (Denscombe, 2010), the following ingredients are common. Terminology varies widely across research traditions, so before you submit to a journal check if yours fits with that of most authors.

1 Setting/context: Design researchers are well aware of the importance of context. Hence a description of the setting in which the research took place is crucial. It is up to you which characteristics you think are important. In some countries, these include whether the school was urban, suburban, or rural. In my own country, this feature is not so informative. More informative is probably if the educational setting has a long tradition of using technology, collaborative learning, puts professional development high on its agenda, etc.

2 Participants: In design research, I mostly prefer using a term like "participants" to avoid connotations that a "sample" has. When readers see the term sample, they will immediately wonder: Was this sample taken randomly? Do you aim for statistical generalization?

3 Instruments/design/tasks: Think of interview schemes, assessment, and questionnaires, but also design specific instruments such as a hypothetical learning trajectory (conjecture map, scenario, learning progression, etc.). The design itself is also sometimes seen as an instrument. You may have to explain the tasks or learning activities.

4 Data collection: Which data did you collect and how? How did you ensure quality assurance? Avoid overlap with the previous subsection: If you only do interviews, it looks artificial to separate the description of your interview scheme from the interviews themselves. This is also the place to tell whether audio recordings were transcribed (verbatim or otherwise).

5 Data analysis: How did you analyze the data? Did you use validation procedures such as member checking? How did you make this process reliable? This is also the place to report Cronbach's alpha or similar measures for assessment or questionnaires, and Cohen's kappa for interrater reliability. Such measures tell something about the quality of the data analysis and are not considered to be part of the results, hence they are reported in the methods section. The same holds for checking whether conducting particular statistical analyses is appropriate (normality, collinearity, homogeneity, etc.).

\section{Results}

There are a few pieces of advice here that are worth sharing. First, early career researchers sometimes stick too close to their data (see Chapter 21 for an example). They cite from their transcripts to illustrate particular points or describe interesting phenomena without rising enough to a more theoretical perspective. If you present a case, what is it a case of?

Readers should never wonder "Why am I reading this?" This means you have to provide a good story with sufficient theoretical explanation and practical detail. It is through theoretical generalization that illustrations are powerful.

A common dilemma is how much to discuss the findings already in the results section. In general, you will find very few references to other work in results sections and little discussion, but there are situations where the readability deteriorates if you postpone remarks or discussion points to the last section. As with other guidelines on writing, they should never become a straightjacket, but rather be a heuristic for what to do when in doubt.

In design research, it is especially important to highlight the mechanisms that you think describe how learning or teaching proceeds, and how these may be connected to particular design features.

\section{Discussion}

The most common structure of the last section is to repeat the purpose or main question of the study and summarize how you achieved this purpose or answered this question. You may need to summarize answers to subquestions too. Then you can discuss the relevance and meaning of your findings. In a design study report, it may be necessary to demarcate explicitly which claims can be made and which claims cannot. Typical subsections include: limitations, recommendations for practice, and future research.

\section{Making your writing coherent}

So far I have concentrated on the subsequent elements of an empirical research paper. However, one of the most important features of a good manuscript is coherence. 

\section{Lack of coherence}

Lack of coherence is much more apparent than coherence itself. Do you recognize any of the following feedback on your own texts?

- This comes out of the blue.

- What is the line of reasoning/thread exactly? The argumentation could be tighter.

- What is the focus of your paper?

- What has $X$ to do with $Y$ ?

- What is your main message?

- Do you really need this concept/theory/passage?

- Your goal and research question are not really in line.

- Your research question is not really answered.

- Are the subquestions really helping to answer the main research question?

- How is this study related to the bigger project?

- You do not refer to all figures/tables.

- There are missing references and references you do not cite in the text.

- What does "this" refer to? What is this issue/this research?

All these questions and comments refer to some lack of coherence. Some refer to missing links at the micro or sentence level (what does the word "this" refer to?), while others have to do with the macro level or overall structure of the paper. Some questions have to do with references within the text; others with the logic of the paper.

In the remainder of this chapter, I classify different types of coherence. But let me first address the question:What does coherence mean? Dictionaries state something like the following: Forming a whole that fits together.Your writing is coherent if everything is logically laid out and connected. ${ }^{1}$ Coherence leads to continuity (flow): Some papers read seamlessly from the first sentence to the last because all information is concisely formulated and all connections are aptly expressed.

\section{Why is coherence so important?}

Educational research has shown that people find it easier to read a coherent text than a less coherent one and they remember better what the text is about (Kamalski, Sanders, \& Lentz, 2008; McNamara, Kintsch, Songer, \& Kintsch, 1996; Sanders, Land, \& Mulder, 2007). Thus a coherent text communicates your message better than a text with some missing connections. It is therefore not surprising that coherence is something that editors, reviewers, and supervisors look for. A lack of coherence is easily spotted and often criticized.

I once sat next to two students, Joan and Norman (pseudonyms), who read each other's introductions to research proposals. Norman could easily summarize Joan's proposal, whereas Joan complained she did not really know what Norman's proposal was about. "It is odd how some texts are easy to follow. I don't know what causes that." Surprise, surprise; this has to do with coherence.

A coherent text focuses on what it is about. Ideas are easy to follow, and links are as expected or logical:The text is transparent. The spectacles metaphor can illuminate this notion: When your spectacles are dirty, you are distracted; you see the glasses themselves (Roth, 2003). But once you can see through them, they help you see something outside, and you do not notice the spectacles anymore. This is why a coherent text mostly does not draw any attention to itself: The reader can focus on the content instead. Readers are not disturbed by missing reasoning steps or lack of clarity over what the authors are talking about.

\section{What makes a text fit together?}

Using Brandom's (2000) semantic theory of inferentialism, I distinguish two types of relations that keep ideas and texts together: inferential and referential relations (cf. Bakker \& Derry, 2011). Inferential relations have to do with logic and reasoning. Referential relations link something in the text to something else in or outside the text (see Table 7.1).

Inevitably, when I make such distinctions, there are also boundary cases in which a relation can be both inferential and referential. Let me start with the inferential relations because they are the most important and difficult type of "glue" that makes papers fit together.

\section{Guidelines for improving inferential relations}

\section{Focus}

Focus is very important for a paper to be coherent: The text has to be at the service of one main message that the reader can remember and tell somebody else in a one-minute elevator chat.

G4:Try to summarize the main message of your paper in 12 to 16 words.

Table 7.I Examples of inferential and referential relations

Inferential relations

- Question - answer

- Premise - conclusion (if - then)

- Goal - achievement

- Means - end

- $X$ is a reason for $Y$

- After $X$ one expects $Y$

- $X$ is necessary information to understand $Y$ Referential relations

- Reference to a larger project or field of research

- Reference to another publication

- Reference to table or figure

- Reference to something in the text (problem, challenge, section, demonstrative pronoun such as "this") Do not rest until you have one focus. If you have two goals, try to see if one is at the service of the other (e.g., identify problems at the service of identifying potential solutions). The most common criticism I have seen in reviews is that the focus is not clear or not consistent. A good way to check the focus of your paper is to highlight all sentences that could be interpreted as indicating the focus: title, core sentences in the abstract, and sentences that capture the aim, research question, or conclusion. Then read all highlighted text in one go to see if all these sentences are consistent.

\section{Identify the main research function}

A research project has a main function (Plomp, 2013), for example to

- describe or define

- compare

- evaluate

- explain

- design

- advise.

It is very common for research projects to have phases with different functions, one of which can be to design, such as in design research. Oftentimes, it is necessary to describe a situation before it can be evaluated, and to evaluate before advice for improvement can be asserted. The main research goal is then to advise researchers - the other phases are at the service of this higher goal. In such a case, the research question is typically evaluative, because a piece of advice is mostly based on something that has been evaluated as effective.

Research questions should reflect the research function (otherwise your text is inconsistent at this point):

- To describe (e.g., what conceptions of sampling do Grade 7 students have?)

- To compare (e.g., does method A lead to better test scores than method B?)

- To evaluate (e.g., how well do students develop an understanding of distribution in this instructional sequence?)

- To explain or to predict (e.g., why do so few students choose a bachelor's degree in mathematics or science? What will students do when using a particular software package?)

- To design (e.g., what constitutes a learning trajectory in which students use modeling to learn about evolution? How can teachers learn to scaffold their students' mathematical language?)

- To advise (e.g., how can secondary school students be supported to learn about correlation and regression?). For example, a what-question is often descriptive (what are characteristics of ...). Evaluative questions often include language like "how well." Explanatory questions can generally be recognized by formulations such as "why" or "what are explanations for ..."Advice questions often start with "how should ..." Or "what is a good/the best way to ...?"

G5: Identify the main research function addressed in your paper and ensure that the formulation of your question is consistent with this function.

Sticking to such conventions helps the reader to identify the type of research carried out, and foresee the kind of research methods used. Sometimes, I see descriptive research questions in a context that clearly suggests the researchers actually want to evaluate or give advice.

\section{Only introduce what you need}

The Russian playwright Anton Chekhov is well known for his one-liner:" One must never place a loaded rifle on the stage if it isn't going to go off. It's wrong to make promises you don't mean to keep" (Goldberg, 1976, p. 163). Students often feel the need to show they know the theories or concepts used in a particular area. Or they identify knowledge gaps that are not filled in this particular paper. If you identify something in your introduction that is unsolved or unknown, the reader will expect your paper to contribute to a solution. In other words:

G6: Only introduce elements (concepts, theories) that you will need to position your research, clarify key concepts, or analyze your data. Otherwise, you raise expectations you cannot fulfill.

\section{Guidelines for improving referential relations}

\section{Relations with a larger project}

One of the key challenges for PhD students is to "cut up the elephant" (an expression I first heard from Albert Pilot). Unless a research project is split into well-defined smaller studies, it can be hard to demarcate what should be addressed in a single paper and what should be left out. This challenge is especially prominent in design based research and large projects with many facets. Think carefully about how you phrase the goal of the larger project and, in relation to that, how the goal of the specific study you report on fits into the bigger picture. Chapters 6 and 8 address aspects of this challenge. 

\section{Relations with objects outside the text}

A common source of confusion is that authors use different terms for the same thing (e.g., instructional materials, educational sequence, module, unit). Like Wallwork (2011) says, my advice is:

G7:Vary words that are not technical (especially within one paragraph), but stick to the same word for each technical or scientific object of interest.

Hence it is fine to use synonyms for terms such as importance (value, need, requirement), but if your paper is about an educational unit, use the same term consistently throughout your text. Otherwise, readers might think you mean something different as soon as you use the term module or sequence. If you use the word "purpose" in your introduction, use the same word again in your discussion: If you use synonyms such as "goal" or "aim," readers will take an extra thinking step or might even wonder for a second whether you mean something else than in the introduction.

\section{Relations within the text}

Relations within the text might sound rather trivial. Yet flaws in this area are common.

References to sources of information:

1 Make sure you refer to all figures and tables in the text.

2 Make sure your list of references is complete, and all references are cited in the text.

3 If you refer to a section, make sure you use the right number or title of the section.

References at the sentence and paragraph level:

Ensure that each sentence links with the next (Wallwork, 2011). Sentences start with a topic and end with the focus on what you want to write about it. This focus becomes the topic of the next sentence. The end of a paragraph should link with the start of the following paragraph. If you are tempted to copy and paste text from other positions, ensure that links with the surrounding text are restored. In my experience, this mostly requires full rewriting of what was copied and pasted initially.

G8: Avoid copying and pasting text, because it mostly leads to incoherence. Flow is best achieved by writing without interruption.

One of the most common flaws in referring to terms is the use of demonstrative pronouns such as this. Whenever you use or read this word, ask yourself: Is what it refers to clear? Take an excerpt in a fictional paper like this one (Lehrer \& Schauble, 2012). This research ... When writing this, students mostly refer to their own research, not to the aforementioned research cited in the reference. To avoid confusion, I recommend something like the following: "The research project reported in this paper" or avoiding a reference to someone else's work just before "this."

The APA guidelines also advise using "I", or "we" ("my," "our," etc.) to make references clear. Another advantage of I and we is that they make it easier to use the active voice. Note, however, that "we" should refer to the authors, not to some general "we," because it is often not clear what this "we" refers to: author and reader together, society, or people in the discipline?

\section{Textbox 7.1}

Question: Is a coherent text a good text?

Response: Not necessarily. A coherent text may be superficial, too limited, or without enough substance. A good manuscript may have some flaws in coherence, which are compensated by depth, quality of the research, interesting results, or implications of the ideas presented.

\section{Textbox 7.2}

Question: What if an interesting idea or observation in the study does not fit the research goal or research question? Would writing about it make my paper less coherent?

Response:Yes, when aiming for coherence, I would say: Leave this idea out and try to get it across in another paper. However, you may have limited time to write papers, or you may lack empirical data to justify another paper on the same topic. One solution then could be to weave your idea into the discussion section of your paper, because this is the place for generating hypotheses and potential explanations. At the end of the paper you have more freedom to bring in ideas that are not strictly tied to the research aim and question.
